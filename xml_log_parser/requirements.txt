# XML Log Parser - Requirements
# All libraries are part of Python's standard library
# No external dependencies required!

# Python 3.7+ includes:
# - xml.etree.ElementTree (XML parsing)
# - tkinter (GUI)
# - json (JSON export)
# - re (regex for pattern matching)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - threading (async operations)

# For reference, if you need to verify your Python installation:
# Run: python --version
# Should show: Python 3.7.0 or higher

# Optional: For better GUI experience on some systems
# tkinter (usually comes with Python, but on some Linux systems may need installation)
# Linux users: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
